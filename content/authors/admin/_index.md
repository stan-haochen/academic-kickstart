Hao Chen is a third-year PhD student of computer science in [Adelaide Intelligent Machines Group](https://github.com/aim-uofa) at [the University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). He is advised by Professor [Chunhua Shen](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~chhshen/). Before coming to Adelaide he obtained his undergraduate and master degree from Zhejiang University, and had been a researcher in NetEase Inc.

He anticipates to graduate in late 2020.

His general research interest lies in probabilistic methods for general perception tasks in computer vision. His recent research involves:

* Fast NAS: computation-friendly neural architecture search (NAS) with reinforcement learning for segmentation, detection and low-level tasks.
* BlendMask: a general instance segmentation framework which is both faster and more efficient than Mask-RCNN.
* AdelaiDet: a collection of recent projects dealing with different instance-level tasks.
