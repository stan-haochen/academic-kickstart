abstract: "**Contributed equally with the first author.** In this work we attempt to come up with generalisation of dynamic cells in video segmentation, and instead of manually designing contextual blocks that connect per-frame outputs, we propose a neural architecture search solution, where the choice of operations together with their sequential arrangement are being predicted by a separate neural network."
