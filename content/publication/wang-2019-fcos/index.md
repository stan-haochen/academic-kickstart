abstract: "**Contributed equally with the first two authors.** We built upon our CVPR19 work for object detection on COCO. At first I thought it would be easy but we met many obstacles mostly about training efficiency. Even up to now I cannot say that we have dealt with all of those. However, this is what we got after grinding for almost a year."
